<h1 align="center">Well Hello Guys Ayush Choudhary</h1>
<h3 align="center">Python (Tkinter) | UI UX Dev (Beginner) | SEO (Beginner)</h3>

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **AMP (Engine Optimization) | Static Data Linkage (UI UX)**

- ðŸ’¬ Recently I have learned about **UI UX And Stack linkage**

- ðŸ“« My Email Address - **12choudharyayush@gmail.com**

- âš¡ Fun fact **Java is to Java script, what Car is to Carpet**

- I am currently pursuing Bachelor in Technology Honours in Computer science with specilization in Aritifical Intelligence and Machine Learning

- Strengths :Having good Conceptual and Leardership Skills have been a plus point for me. Communications is a major . Quite Interested in the a few Programming and Markup languages. Search Engine Optimization Beginner , UI UX Developer (Beginner) , can be considered as a quick learner, have knowledge of basics C, and HTML.

- Hobbies: I am a passive reader and reads quite a lot of stuff. Three of my favourites are 
- 1.) Faithful Place (By Tana French)
- 2.)The Diabolic (S.J Kincaid)
- 3.)A Dance with Dragons  ( George R. R. Martin)

- I love watching Formula Categories (Not "One" Specificly) , and Love karting as well though that depends on what's left in my monthly allowance. I won't say I am an Extrovert but I love interacting and making new connections. And the one thing I have been Excelling recently in is overthink the smallest things the are out there. I have been participating in Hacktoerfest since 2019 , Finally managed to get 4 Quality project related PRs Approved this year , Have participated in Google Clouds Event as well (But didn't completed the tasks due to time constraint) , So over the last couple of years , I have finally realised the passion I got for Programming and Leanring new things related to UI.
Hackathons , GSOC etc.? well Been working on all that.Watching Movies of Thriller,Sci-fi,Comedy and Listenning Music, I don't Consider these as Hobbies because that's how the life goes on , Everyone have these in common

- Weaknesses:Overthinking is the biggest weakness I have . Sometimes Vocubulary bites really hard as well so that effects the communication Skills and is kinda problematic. So Overcoming that is one of my major priority for now

- Goals: I have been working on personal Project kinda thing which is , basically Using AI to assist SEO (generating Meta and Keywords with Minimal Traffic).For now Making it's Static Data is priority , And learning Web/App development Simulaneously to make further Progress.
